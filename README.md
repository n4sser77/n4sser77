# 👋 Hi, I’m @n4sser77 — also known as Naser Al-Asbahi

## 👀 I’m interested in ...
- Building **modern full-stack apps** with **React (TypeScript)** and **ASP.NET Core**
- Designing **scalable backend APIs** and practical systems that solve real problems
- Exploring **self-hosting** on **Linux**, **VPS**, and **Raspberry Pi 5**
- Learning about **cross-platform desktop development** with **Avalonia**
- Understanding how **real-time audio** and frameworks like **JUCE (C++)** work — something I’ve only explored lightly so far

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Getting deeper into **React + TypeScript (Vite)** and **ASP.NET Core** — both **Minimal APIs** and **MVC**
- Improving my knowledge of **deployment pipelines and DevOps basics** through **Azure**, **Netlify**, and a little **Nginx**
- Building and distributing **.NET CLI tools**, like my `codestats` CLI mvp
- Managing small **self-hosted systems** and experimenting with automation

## 💼 Experience & Projects
- **LearningWell (LIA Internship)** — Developed a React/TypeScript frontend and ASP.NET Core backend with XUnit & vitest testing for both backend and frontend, following Clean Code principles and agile methods.  
- **Hackathons (Cillers, Couchbase, Kong API)** — Built prototypes for resilient and agentic ai systems under short timeframes.  
- **Personal Projects** — Experimenting with self-hosted APIs, React apps, and custom CLI tools, JUCE c++ apps and many other prototypes

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- Projects that combine **React frontends** with **.NET Core APIs**
- **CLI tools**, **open-source utilities**, or experimental **learning projects**
- Anything that helps me grow while staying close to real-world problem-solving
