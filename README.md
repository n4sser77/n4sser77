# 👋 Hi, I’m @n4sser77 also known as Naser Al-Asbahi

## 👀 I’m interested in ...
- Modern web development, scalable backend systems, and database management. I also like to deploy and try some systems for my personal use on my raspberry pi 5

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- ASP.NET Core MVC and deepening my knowledge of .NET technologies. Also I hear blazor is just as great as react and so is muai.

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- Next.js projects, TailwindCSS design implementations, and backend systems using Node.js. Getting kinda rusty on javascript since I'v been coding c# and .NET.
